# Who am I? 👨‍💻

I am a self-taught software engineer based in Seattle, WA. I have been working in tech for over 15 years.

In March 2022 I decided to take a short break to focus on my personal [projects](https://danielesalatti.com/projects) and explore my other interests. Today am am continuing to do that while working for Gitcoin DAO.

If you want to get in touch or are interested in hiring me, my [contact information is below](#contact).

## A brief history

I started learning to code when I was 11. I started my career in software development when I was 16 during summer in high school. Born and raised in [Livorno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livorno) - on the western coast of Tuscany, Italy - I worked for a few years as a software engineer at a startup company in nearby Florence. Fun fact: I ended up consulting at Gucci.

I wanted to experience life abroad and I decided to move to Copenhagen, Denmark. I lived there for 3 years working for a company called Secunia (later acquired by [Flexera](https://www.flexera.com/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research)) before [Amazon](https://amazon.com) hired me and moved me to Dublin, Ireland.

After about 2 years there was an opportunity to move to the Amazon HQ in Seattle and I took it. I continued to work for Amazon until August 2020, in the midst of the pandemic, for a total of about 6 years.

I decided to join [Meta](https://meta.com) (aka Facebook) in December 2020, and I staid there until March 2022.

I then took some time to myself, to learn new things and explore my interests. I'm working on [my projects](https://danielesalatti.com/projects) and making an effort to document it on [my blog](https://danielesalatti.com). In June 2022 I joined [Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co).
