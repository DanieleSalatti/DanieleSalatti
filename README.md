### Ciao 👋

# Who am I? 👨‍💻

I am a self-taught software engineer based in Seattle, WA. I have been working in tech for over 15 years.

In March 2022 I decided to take a short break to focus on my personal [projects](https://danielesalatti.com/projects) and explore my other interests. Today am am continuing to do that while growing my business.

If you want to get in touch or are interested in hiring me, my [contact information is below](#contact).

## What am I working on?

Coming soon...

## A brief history

I started learning to code when I was 11. I started my career in software development when I was 16 during summer in high school. Born and raised in [Livorno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livorno) - on the western coast of Tuscany, Italy - I worked for a few years as a software engineer at a startup company in nearby Florence. Fun fact: I ended up consulting at Gucci.

I wanted to experience life abroad and I decided to move to Copenhagen, Denmark. I lived there for 3 years working for a company called Secunia (later acquired by [Flexera](https://www.flexera.com/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research)) before [Amazon](https://amazon.com) hired me and moved me to Dublin, Ireland.

After about 2 years there was an opportunity to move to the Amazon HQ in Seattle and I took it. I continued to work for Amazon until August 2020, in the midst of the pandemic, for a total of about 6 years.

I decided to join [Meta](https://meta.com) (aka Facebook) in December 2020, and I staid there until March 2022.

I then took some time to myself, to learn new things and explore my interests. I'm working on [my projects](https://danielesalatti.com/c/projects) and making an effort to document it on [my blog](https://danielesalatti.com).
